**Description**:

The React Native app, developed using Typescript, will serve as the client-facing interface for the cloth shopping application. The app will have an admin role, providing advanced functionalities for managing the application, including:

- Product management: Admins can add, update, and remove clothing products, and manage details, inventory, and pricing.
- User management: Admins can view, modify, and deactivate user accounts.
- Order management: Admins can monitor and manage customer orders, including status, shipping, and fulfillment.
- Analytics and reporting: Admins can access data and analytics related to product sales, customer behavior, and other key metrics.

The React Native app will communicate with the backend .NET API to handle data-related operations and business logic. By leveraging React Native, the app will provide a seamless and responsive user experience across iOS and Android platforms.
